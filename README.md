# QB-Core
Zombie spawning script
Note that this script assumes you have the `qb-core` resource properly installed and running in your FiveM server. The `CreateSoundTrigger` function is a custom function that you'll need to implement yourself. It should create a sound trigger at the given position and trigger the provided callback when a player enters the trigger area.

Make sure to update the `Config` table with the appropriate values for your server, such as zombie models, boss models, spawn points, red zones, safe zones, and sound range.

Remember to test and tweak the script as needed for your specific server setup.
